# Virtual-Influencer-Instagram-Comments-Sentiment-Analysis-App
An interactive sentiment analysis application designed to evaluate the tone of Instagram comments on virtual influencers' posts. After performing data preprocessing for NLP and implementing the necessary NLP techniques, I trained machine learning and deep learning models, and fine-tuned a BERT model. I chose the model that provided the best evaluation metrics based on the available data and deployed it in a Flask web app with a user-friendly interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Customized NLP preprocessing pipeline for Instagram comments.
- **Multiple Models:** Trains and evaluates machine learning, deep learning, and BERT-based models to find the best fit.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Deployed as a Flask app with a clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end.
- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis:** Allows users to input Instagram comments for real-time analysis.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Machine Learning:** nltk, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Transformers
